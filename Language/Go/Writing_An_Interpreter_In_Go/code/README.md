# Writing An Interpreter In Go

Thank you for purchasing "Writing An Interpreter In Go"!

In the `code` folder you'll find final result of each chapter. The code should be compilable and runnable if  you set your GOPATH to the top-level folder for each chapter. 

Every chapter folder also contains an `.envrc` file. 

If you have direnv (http://direnv.net/) installed then the $GOPATH should be automatically
set for you as soon as you `cd` into the directories.

If you have any question, send me an email: me@thorstenball.com

Enjoy the book!
